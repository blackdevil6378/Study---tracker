## 🔑 How to Get Your Free API Keys

> **Note**: API keys are optional to explore demo courses, but required for live YouTube imports and AI Mentor chat. Keys are stored solely in your local browser and sent through standard request headers to Next.js API routes (`/api/gemini`, `/api/groq`, and `/api/youtube`). They are **never hardcoded and never logged**.

### 1. Google Gemini API Key (Free)
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2. Sign in with your Google account.
3. Click **"Create API key"** and select or create a Google Cloud project.
4. Copy the API key (starts with `AIzaSy...`).
5. In Study Tracker, navigate to **Settings**, paste your key, and click **"Test Key"**.

### 2. Groq API Key (Free)
1. Go to [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/keys).
2. Sign in and create a new API key.
3. Copy the key and paste it in the Study Tracker Settings page.
4. Choose the `Groq` provider in AI Mentor settings and select from the latest models (e.g. `openai/gpt-oss-120b`, `openai/gpt-oss-20b`, `qwen/qwen3.8-27b`, `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`, or fetch live models from your account).

### 3. YouTube Data API v3 Key (Free)
1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project (e.g., `Study-Tracker-Project`).
3. In the search bar at the top, search for **"YouTube Data API v3"** and click **Enable**.
4. Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
5. Click **+ Create Credentials > API Key**.
6. (Recommended) Click **Edit API Key** and set **API Restrictions** to restrict the key exclusively to *YouTube Data API v3*.
7. In Study Tracker, navigate to **Settings**, paste the key, and click **"Test Key"**.

## 💻 Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js `18.18+` or `20+` or `22+`
- npm, pnpm, or yarn

### Steps
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. (Optional) Configure Supabase cloud sync in .env.local
#    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
#    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-publishable-or-anon-key

# 3. Run the development server
npm run dev

# 4. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
```

### Supabase Cloud Sync Setup
1. Create a project at [Supabase](https://supabase.com/dashboard).
2. In **Project Settings > API**, copy the Project URL and the publishable key (or legacy `anon` key) into `.env.local` using the variable names above. Never use a `service_role` key in a browser app.
3. In the Supabase **SQL Editor**, run [`supabase/schema.sql`](./supabase/schema.sql). It creates the per-user `user_data` table and row-level security policies.
4. In **Authentication > Providers > Email**, enable email/password sign-in. Configure email confirmation as desired.
5. Restart the Next.js dev server. Create an account or sign in; existing local study data is uploaded only when that account has no cloud record. Otherwise the cloud copy is loaded.
6. Deployments need the same two `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*` environment variables set in their hosting provider.

Cloud sync saves the app's study data and non-secret preferences. Gemini, Groq, and YouTube API keys are excluded from the cloud payload and need to be entered separately on each device. Simultaneous edits from multiple devices use last-write-wins; reopening the app loads the latest saved cloud copy.

## 🚢 Deploying on Vercel (Zero Configuration)

1. Push your repository to GitHub / GitLab / Bitbucket.
2. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and click **"Add New Project"**.
3. Import your repository.
4. Framework Preset will automatically detect **Next.js**.
5. Click **Deploy**.
6. That's it! Users can enter their API keys directly in the web app UI on the **Settings** page.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. **Browser Notification Limitations**:
   - Web Push and Notification APIs require the web browser or PWA window to be open or running in the background.
   - On iOS (Safari/WebKit), Web Push notifications are only supported if you add the app to your Home Screen as a PWA (iOS 16.4+).
2. **YouTube API Quotas**:
   - Google Cloud provides a default free quota of **10,000 units/day** for YouTube Data API v3.
   - Fetching playlist items costs ~1 unit per 50 videos; fetching video durations costs ~1 unit per 50 videos. A 500-video playlist costs roughly 20–25 units.
3. **Browser LocalStorage Quotas**:
   - Standard browser `localStorage` provides **5MB** of storage. Study Tracker monitors this in Settings and alerts you when 80% capacity is reached so you can export a backup JSON.
